h1. dizzy.js

Dizzy enables you to create non-linear presentations on a single canvas, using SVG and Javascript.
There is a version of the "online editor":http://dizzy.cascone.net for presentation files available, although you could also host your own with the newer code provided here (no serverside code needed). (:

If you wanan try it, I just suggest to use the same browser for editing and viewing :)

h2. Browser support

All modern browsers are supported (no ideas about Internet Explorer), but:
- Chrome has some problems in saving (opening is fine) presentations with images
- Opera selects the text on the canvas simply moving the mouse (it's annoying but everything else works anyway)


h2. Contribute

If you want to develop for Dizzy check out the dev branch (contains everything including tools, so it may take some time). There will be some information on how to write new modules on the Wiki shortly. If you have any questions regarding development, you can message me on github or, even better, open an issue on this repository.
